# Kneedle
A fast approach to get array items after a knee point (clockwise)

------------


Based on the work of [Ville Satop채채 et al](https://raghavan.usc.edu/papers/kneedle-simplex11.pdf "Ville Satop채채 et al"), this algorithm finds the first knee point and returns the rest of the sequence. This simplified version only checks for the first knee point and could be used to filter out noisy elements off a list of items.
